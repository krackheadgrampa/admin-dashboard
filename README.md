# admin-dashboard
The aim of this experiment was to understand how an admin dashboard layout can be created using CSS Grid.
I divided the page into sidebar, header, content area and footer. CSS Grid helped in arranging these sections properly.
For theme switching, a simple JavaScript logic is used to change between light and dark modes. This helped me understand how CSS classes can be controlled using JavaScript.
This experiment improved my understanding of layout design and basic DOM manipulation.
