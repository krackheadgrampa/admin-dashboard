Develop an Admin Dashboard with CSS Grid Layout and Dynamic Theme Switching
3-Defined Approach
The objective of this experiment was to design a simple admin dashboard layout using modern CSS Grid concepts and implement dynamic theme switching functionality.
The dashboard structure is divided into sidebar, header, main content area, and footer using CSS Grid. This helps in maintaining a clean and responsive layout.
For theme switching, JavaScript is used to toggle between light and dark modes by changing the class of the body element. This approach avoids complex logic and keeps the implementation simple and readable.
The project uses only HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to clearly demonstrate the core concepts without relying on external frameworks.
